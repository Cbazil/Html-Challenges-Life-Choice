        <!-- Essay on what I've learn't in the HTML Module -->
    <br>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, san-serif; font-size: 20px">
        I've learnt that HTML stands for HTML(Hypertext Markup Language). I've learnt That the WWW(World Wide Web) is put together by HTML codes and that the internet is just a bunch of computers connected to one another.
        I've learnt Different html tags/elements has the heading tags <strong>h1</strong> right through to <strong>h6</strong> and it's most important to less base on the number, The smaller the number the more important
        the header is. The website looks for <em><strong>h1</strong></em> with is heading 1, and that's the heading of the webpage and that's how the page is found if ever searched by the user.
        <br>
        <br>
         I've learnt how to create an article webpage, create an online database table which i found interesting and exciting.
        The challenges was challenging but it helped me as an individual learn how to think on my feet and actually be the problem solver I claimed to be, these challenges helped me explore with creativity and it even helped me  build enthusiasm for code. I was educated and motivated throughout this module that contained fun activities.
        It's such a great experience to see what I can creat out of simple html coding, it always ceases to amaze me with every new challenge that came my way.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the end, all seemed to worked out and everything I've learnt through out the module added up and helped me in every challenge. I enjoyed creating a surver, the challenge was one where I learn't a bunch of new and interesting tags.
        Other then the new tags I've came to know, this is where the structioning of a simple html Document came in, And it's where I played a bit around to My liking and I've learnt how to structure a webpage so that it can be user freindly to all users.
