<h1>Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids From Tech Addiction</h1>

<span style="color:#585854; font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px; ">We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. The answers <br>were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.</span>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is my husband.<br> It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. Not wanting to be left out, my <br>16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone.<br> It is the cutest/most pathetic thing.”</p>
<br>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small child’s burgeoning tech addiction.<br> Like most parents, that mom lives a waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time<br> (an average American adult spends about 11 hours a day looking at a screen). <br>She, like many modern parents, sees her own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits.<br> She doesn’t always like what she sees.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">Even as we learn about the potential pitfalls of our increasingly technology-addled lifestyles, our<br> dependence on tech shows little sign of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is <br>getting louder, especially when it comes to kids.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;" >In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at Facebook, said<br> that the social network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.”<br> Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google, told Wired that Apple, Google, Facebook,<br> Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention. In January, two<br> Apple investors asked the company to study the health effects of its products on children.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from some the most powerful tech<br> companies–including Apple, Google, and Facebook–formed the Center for Humane Technology.<br> In partnership with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group plans to lobby<br> against addictive tech, and is kicking off with a $7 million “Truth about Tech” ad campaign that<br> they plan to deliver to 55,000 public schools.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding<br> together to warn parents, about the monster they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are<br> starting to question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign,<br> no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–especially when kids<br> these days are being introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book, The Art of Screen Time Anya<br>  Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds)that found that young<br> kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all types of) screens.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast Company surveyed nearly 400 parents.<br> We tried to look at the issue from all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have,<br> to the types of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to the benefits<br> that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own<br> tech addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few other countries).<br> Their professions span many industries, including marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, <br>video production, law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging from <br>7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words,<br> these parents are in the thick of parenting.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:20px;">Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a conclusive sample–but, <br>along with expert research, these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents<br> in our tech-dependent era.</p>
