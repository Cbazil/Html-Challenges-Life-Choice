        Publishing Tables
        The most commonly published object is a table. The following links provide additional information about areas related to publishing tables:

        <li>Filter Published Data</li>
        
        <li>Article Options for Transactional Replication</li>
        
        <li>Article Options for Merge Replication</li>
        
        Replicate Identity Columns
        </ul>
        When publishing a table for replication, you can specify which schema objects should be copied to the Subscriber, such as declared referential integrity (primary key constraints, reference constraints, unique constraints), indexes, user DML triggers (DDL triggers cannot be replicated), extended properties, and collation. Extended properties are replicated only in the initial synchronization between the Publisher and the Subscriber. If you add or modify an extended property after the initial synchronization, the change is not replicated.</p>

        An old book opened to columns of numbers labeled sinus, tangens and secans Facing pages from a 1619 book of mathematical tables by Matthias Bernegger, showing values for the sine, tangent and secant trigonometric functions. Angles less than 45° are found on the left page, angles greater than 45° on the right. Cosine, cotangent and cosecant are found by using the entry on the opposite page.
Mathematical tables are lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments. Before calculators were cheap and plentiful, people would use such tables to simplify and drastically speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics.

    <p><strong><li>Periodic Table</li></strong>
        The periodic table of elements, often shortened to just the periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties, whose structure shows periodic trends. Generally, within one row (period) the elements are metals to the left, and non-metals to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called periods and columns are called groups. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.

        A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modeling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.

    <p><strong><li>Applications software</li></strong><br>An application software (app or application for short) is computer software designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user. Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, a media player, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor. The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively.[1] This contrasts with system software, which is mainly involved with running the computer.
