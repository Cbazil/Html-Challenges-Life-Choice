        <!-- Random content from an Article -->
        <article>It is no secret content has been reigning as king for quite some time. In fact, according to LinkedIn, 4.6 billion pieces of content are produced daily. Around 92,000 of those are new articles posted to the Internet. While it might feel like your current content strategy is “on fleek,” a quick look at those numbers could cause slight panic from an ROI perspective.

                In a web of endless articles, how do you know if your content is sticking with your audience? With email, SEO and social media posts, it is easy to track engagement and viewership – with content, however, it can be a little bit more challenging. That was until, the introduction of the article tag.
                
                Tagging refers to the metadata that is assigned to a piece of content by the content creator and the readers/users of the content. Article tags are not necessarily a new concept, but the partnership of content with tags is a budding romance. A recent report from analytics company Parse.ly found publishers using tags in creative ways to help guide their content approach.
                
                Tags originally began as a way to surface content in Google searches or archive pages – boost SEO, if you will. Publishers, however, have now been utilizing these tags for their internal marketing strategy – providing both data and direction – for the use of content optimization.
